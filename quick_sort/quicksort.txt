Overview

* Divide and Conquer algorithm
 - Breaks down problem into multiple subproblems recursively until they become simple to solve. 
 - Solutions are combined to solve original problem.

* Running time
 - O(n^2) worst case
 - O(n * log(n)) best and average case

General Principle

* Quicksort
1. Choose pivot element (usually last or random)

2. Stores elements less than pivot in left subarray. 
 2.1 Stores elements greater than pivot in right subarray.

3. Call quicksort recursively on left subarray.
 3.1 Call quicksort recursively on right subarray.
