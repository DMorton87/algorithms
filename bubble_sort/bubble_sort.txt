* What is Bubble_Sort?
 Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. 
 The method works by examining each set of adjacent elements in the string, from left to right, and 
 switching their positions if they are out of order. The algorithm then repeats this process until it can
 run through the entire string and find no two elements that need to be swapped.

*Bubble_Sort Time complexity
 The best-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is: O(n). In this case, we are already dealing with a sorted list.
 The worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is: O(n²). The two nested loops suggest that we are dealing with quadratic time.
 The average time complexity of Bubble Sort case is: O(n²). It's just a slower algorithm, and sometimes that okay. 

*Bubble_Sort Pseudocode
 Procedure bubble_sort(nums):
    Set swapping to True
    While swapping is True:
        Set swapping to False
        For i from the 2nd element to the last element:
            If the (i-1)th element of nums is greater than the ith element:
                Swap the (i-1)th element and the ith element of nums
                Set swapping to True
    Return nums
 End Procedure
